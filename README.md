# HCD-M35WM standby fix

when the cassette-tape drive-belt ages, the speed measured by the 
Sony's microcontroller slows down, which causes the controller to 
decided to shut down the system.  For this reason the other 
functions as for example:  Minidisc, CD, Radio, mp3,... cannot 
be used.  

To fix this it is enough to simulate pulses at the light-barrier.
So the microcontroller will regard the cassette drive as 
functional and will not shutdown the music-system.
